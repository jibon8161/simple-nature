A spiritual classic that has been around for ages. The shining yellow-gold caps and wise teachings give this mushroom strain its rightful name. With a magic mushroom grow kit from this psilocybe cubensis mushroom, you can expect medium size to large mushrooms with wide caps, ideal for spore printing.\n\nIntroduction to the Golden Teacher cubensis\n\nThe Golden Teacher magic mushroom strain is a favorite among cultivators and psychonauts for years. Cultivators love the Golden Teacher spores because they grow in great flushes. And psychonauts love them because the psychedelic journey of these mushrooms is known to have a profound impact.\n\nThe Golden Teacher magic mushroom strain is a psilocybe cubensis, a species of psychedelic mushroom whose main active elements are psilocybin and psilocin.\n\nThe p. cubensis species is the most well-known psilocybin mushroom because they have been widely distributed and they are easy to cultivate in a home setting. Even more with a magic mushroom grow kit,\n\nThe history of the Golden Teacher magic mushroom\n\nSome believe a specimen of the Golden Teacher was found growing wild in Florida, appearing first during the mid-1980s. The word spread around fast, mainly because of the recognizable golden caps with yellow speckles on them. Compared to other Psilocybe Cubensis types, the Golden Teacher magic mushrooms are quite large and elegant in their appearance.\n\nThere is a story that the Golden Teacher was actually a Hawaiian PES, renamed by a Dutch grower because: “sometimes right before the veils break when the primordia are at their largest size before becoming mature, the entire shroom can have a golden yellowish color which vanishes when maturity starts to set in.” Source: from fanaticus.com currently offline.

Psilocybe mexicana A has the ability to form sclerotia beneath the magic mushroom. These small lumps, sometimes referred to as “Philosopher’s stones,” contain very high concentrations of psilocybin, a psychedelic with strong visual effects.\n\nThe shapes and sizes of Mexicana A magic truffles vary, but they all produce similar effects. What determines the nature of the experience are the environment you are in, the people you are with, and of course the dosage.\n\n**Effects**\n\nAfter ten minutes to one hour, you will start to notice the first effects of the magic truffles, seeing and hearing things better and more intensely. The Mexicana A eater notices a rapid change in the perception of ordinary reality. This often comes down to a good series of laughs. This cheerful start soon transcends into confused feelings. This is due to reality looking so different; your mind just cannot grasp it anymore. As the outer confusion intensifies, the inner visions (best seen in a dark room) become clearer.\n\nThe nature of the trip depends upon the person taking it and the mood or state of mind that person is in. So your experience could very well be quite different from what you read here or hear from other people. The trip takes about 6 hours and wears down gradually. The interval between hallucinations gets longer until they disappear completely.\n\nThe active substance in the Magic Truffles Mexicana A Philosopher’s stones is psilocybin, a tryptamine that is chemically similar to the human neurotransmitter DMT (dimethyltryptamine). DMT is one of the strongest visionary psychedelics, which occurs abundantly in nature (trees, grasses, etc.) and is easily broken down by the body’s MAO enzymes, leaving no toxic byproducts behind. Although the body can handle psilocybin quite well, the mind can get quite confused, which is why Atlantis truffles must be taken in a safe, familiar environment, preferably with a sober sitter nearby.\n\n**Mushroom Stopper – Bad Trip Stopper**\n\nIf this will be the first time you use magic truffles, make sure that a sober friend is around to help you out in case you feel uncomfortable, sick, or scared. Click [here](#) to buy our Mushroom Stopper. Our Mushroom Stopper helps you to get out of your trip.\n\n**Storage**\n\nThe Mexicana A are fresh magic truffles and must be stored in your refrigerator (not freezer!), if you do not use them immediately. The truffles can be stored up to a month in your refrigerator.\n\n**Usage**\n\nPlease note: it is possible that during the shipping process, the stones dry a little bit. This decreases their weight. But don’t worry: the remaining truffles are just as strong as the dosage mentioned above.\n\nThe most common and efficient way to use Mexicana A truffles is to eat them raw, on an empty stomach.\n\nBut this doesn’t taste that well, and sometimes leaves a heavy feeling in the stomach, which can be a disturbing sensation while tripping. Although psilocybin is sensitive to heating, it’s possible to make Magic truffles tea, which is more tasty and easy to digest than fresh or dried magic truffles. Boil some water, turn the heat down, and add the (shredded) magic truffles. Let them boil softly for about 20 minutes. You can then add a little honey or sugar and drink the tea. Another method is to simply pour some very hot water on the atlantis truffles, let it soak for about 10 minutes, and then repeat the procedure with new hot water.\n\n**Warning**\n\nDo not use when pregnant, nursing, depressed, on medication, driving motorized vehicles, under 18 years old, in combination with stimulants or alcohol. The first time you use truffles, make sure someone with more experience is around in case you need help, for example, when you feel sick or scared. Treat the Mexicana A truffles with respect, be alert to your environment, and help those who take it for the first time."

It has never again been seen in Florida but a second sighting was reported from Mississippi; however, no culturable material was obtained. Psilocybe tampanensis forms psychoactive sclerotia that are known under the nickname magic truffle.\n\nThe Tampanensis magic truffles contain very high concentrations of psilocybin, a psychedelic with strong visual effects.\n\nThe shapes and sizes of magic truffles vary, but they all produce similar effects. What determines the nature of the experience are the environment you are in, the people you are with, and of course the dosage.\n\n**Effects**\n\nAfter ten minutes to one hour, you will start to notice the first effects, seeing and hearing things better and more intensely. The Tampanensis magic truffle eater notices a rapid change in the perception of ordinary reality. This often comes down to a good series of laughs. This cheerful start soon transcends into confused feelings. This is due to reality looking so different; your mind just cannot grasp it anymore. As the outer confusion intensifies, the inner visions (best seen in a dark room) become clearer.\n\nThe nature of the magic truffles trip depends upon the person taking it and the mood or state of mind that person is in. So your experience could very well be quite different from what you read here or hear from other people.\n\nThe trip takes about 6 hours and wears down gradually. The interval between hallucinations gets longer, until they disappear completely.\n\n**Storage**\n\nThe Tampanensis truffles are fresh truffles and must be stored in your refrigerator (not freezer!), if you do not use them immediately. The truffles can be stored up to a month in your refrigerator.\n\nThe active substance in the Sclerotia Tampanensis truffles is psilocybin, a tryptamine that is chemically similar to the human neurotransmitter DMT (dimethyltryptamine). DMT is one of the strongest visionary psychedelics, which occurs abundantly in nature (trees, grasses, etc.) and is easily broken down by the body’s MAO enzymes, leaving no toxic byproducts behind. Although the body can handle psilocybin quite well, the mind can get quite confused, which is why Atlantis truffles must be taken in a safe, familiar environment, preferably with a sober sitter nearby.\n\n**Usage**\n\nThese are fresh Tampanensi magic truffles and must be kept in the refrigerator. Take 5 to 9 grams for a normal trip and 10 to 15 grams for a strong trip.\n\nPlease note: it is possible that during the shipping process the stones dry a little bit. This decreases their weight. But don’t worry: the remaining truffles are just as strong as the dosage mentioned above.\n\nThe most common and efficient way to use Sclerotia Tampanensis magic truffles is to eat them raw, on an empty stomach.\n\nBut this doesn’t taste that well, and sometimes leaves a heavy feeling in the stomach, which can be a disturbing sensation while tripping. Although psilocybin is sensitive to heating, it’s possible to make atlantis truffle tea, which is more tasty and easy to digest than fresh or dried Tampanensis truffles. Boil some water, turn the heat down and add the (shredded) truffles. Let them boil softly for about 20 minutes. You can then add a little honey or sugar and drink the tea. Another method is to simply pour some very hot water on the atlantis truffles, let it soak for about 10 minutes, and then repeat the procedure with new hot water.\n\n**Warning**\n\nDo not use when pregnant, nursing, depressed, on medication, driving motorized vehicles, under 18 years old, in combination with stimulants or alcohol.\n\nThe first time you use magic truffles make sure someone with more experience is around in case you need help, for example when you feel sick or scared. Treat the atlantis truffles with respect, be alert to your environment and help those who take it for the first time.\n\nWe can ship to you fast."
